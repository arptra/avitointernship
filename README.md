# Avito internship  
Create an HTTP service that can limit the number of requests from one IPv4 subnet. If there are no restrictions, then you need to produce the same static content.  
[Original test task from Antibot Avito Information Security unit](https://github.com/avito-tech/antibot-developer-trainee)  

## A brief overview of what I did  
I implemented:
1) Ð¡lient part on `Python`.  
2) Server part on `Golang`.  
3) Ability to run using `docker-compose up`.  
4) Implemented server reconfiguration `handler` (change prefix, limite, ban, delete time and numder of request).  
5) `handler` to reset the restriction on the subnet address.  
6) `Testing` the functioning of the service.
7) A simple Info webpage to display the necessary information about the service (settings, limited networks, connections), as    well as the ability to reconfigure the service while it run.
